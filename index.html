<p>In the previous exercise, 
    <br>you created HTML by using Emmet in

    short spurts. <a href="https://google.com">This is how you will</a> most often use. However, you can create larger blocks of markup in one go. In this example, we'll create another section of markup all in one line.
    Place your cursor inside the div with a class of columns
    Press enter to add a blank line
    On that line, create the entirety of the second block of markup (Step 2)</p>
